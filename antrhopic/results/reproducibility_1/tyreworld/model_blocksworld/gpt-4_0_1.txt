Based on the given domain information and the action description, here's the PDDL representation for the action "take an object from a container":

Parameters:
1. ?obj - small_object: the object to be taken
2. ?cont - container: the container from which the object is taken

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (container-open ?cont)
    (object-in-container ?obj ?cont)
    (not (robot-has ?obj))
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
    (not (object-in-container ?obj ?cont))
    (robot-has ?obj)
)
```

New Predicates:
No newly defined predicates

This action representation ensures that:
1. The container is open before the robot can take an object from it.
2. The object is actually in the container before it can be taken.
3. The robot is not already holding the object.
4. After the action, the object is no longer in the container and is now held by the robot.

Note that there's no need to add a precondition checking if the robot's hands are free, as the domain information states that there is no restriction on how many objects the robot can carry.

Based on the given domain information and the action description, here's the PDDL representation for the action of removing a wheel from a hub:

Parameters:
1. ?w - wheel: the wheel to be removed
2. ?h - hub: the hub from which the wheel is to be removed

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (wheel-on-hub ?w ?h)
    (hub-jacked-up ?h)
    (hub-unfastened ?h)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
    (not (wheel-on-hub ?w ?h))
    (wheel-removed ?w)
    (hub-free ?h)
)
```

New Predicates:
No new predicates needed. All required predicates were already provided in the list.

This action representation captures the following aspects:
1. The wheel must be on the hub before it can be removed.
2. The hub must be jacked up for safety.
3. The hub must be unfastened (implying that the nut has been removed or loosened).
4. After the action, the wheel is no longer on the hub, it is considered removed, and the hub is free (no wheel on it).

Based on the given domain information and the action description, here's the PDDL representation for the action of putting a wheel on an unfastened hub:

Parameters:
1. ?w - wheel: the wheel to be put on the hub
2. ?h - hub: the hub on which the wheel will be put

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (robot-has ?w)
    (hub-jacked-up ?h)
    (hub-unfastened ?h)
    (hub-free ?h)
    (wheel-intact ?w)
    (wheel-inflated ?w)
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
    (not (robot-has ?w))
    (not (hub-free ?h))
    (wheel-on-hub ?w ?h)
)
```

New Predicates:
No new predicates needed to be defined for this action.

This action representation ensures that:
1. The robot is holding the wheel it wants to put on the hub.
2. The hub is jacked up for safety.
3. The hub is unfastened, allowing the wheel to be put on.
4. The hub is free (no other wheel is currently on it).
5. The wheel being put on is intact and inflated.

After the action is performed:
1. The robot no longer has the wheel.
2. The hub is no longer free.
3. The wheel is now on the hub.

Based on the given domain information and the action description, here's the PDDL representation for the "inflate wheel" action:

Parameters:
1. ?w - wheel: the wheel to be inflated
2. ?p - tool: the pump used for inflation

Preconditions:
```
(and
    (is-pump ?p)
    (robot-has ?p)
    (wheel-intact ?w)
    (not (wheel-inflated ?w))
)
```

Effects:
```
(and
    (wheel-inflated ?w)
)
```

New Predicates:
No new predicates needed. All required predicates were already provided in the given list.

Explanation:
- The action requires two parameters: the wheel to be inflated and the pump to use.
- The preconditions ensure that:
  1. The tool is indeed a pump.
  2. The robot has the pump.
  3. The wheel is intact (not damaged).
  4. The wheel is not already inflated.
- The effect is simply that the wheel becomes inflated.
- No new predicates were needed as all necessary predicates were already provided in the given list.
