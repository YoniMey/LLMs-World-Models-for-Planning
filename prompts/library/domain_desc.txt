The AI agent here is a library logistics planner that has to plan to transport books within the shelves in a library through a cart and between libraries through a delivery van. Within a library, the shelves are directly linked, allowing carts to travel between any two of these shelves. Similarly, libraries are directly connected to each other allowing delivery vans to travel between any two libraries. Each library is equipped with one cart and has a designated shelf that functions as a delivery hub. There are five types of object: book, cart, van, shelf, and library. There are multiple libraries and each library can have multiple shelves. Also, there is no limit to how many books a cart or van can carry (so in theory a cart or van can carry an infinite number of books).
